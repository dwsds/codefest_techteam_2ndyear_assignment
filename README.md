This is a website build using reactjs. On running the website, we first ecounter a login page. If the user doesn't have an existing account, they click on the "Sign Up" link. After signing up/logging in, the user is directed to the Workouts page where they are given the option to create workouts or View/Modify their already created workouts. In the view/modify option, users can delete the workout conviniently by clicking the delete button below every workout. On clicking the modify option, input fields appear for modified values which the user wants the exisitng values to be updated to. On pressing "save changes", it should ideally update the workout, but i am encountering an error here.
If the user wishes to revert back the changes while inputting modified values, they can press "cancel changes".
